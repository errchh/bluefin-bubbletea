# Base Image
FROM ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin-dx:latest

### [IM]MUTABLE /opt
## Some bootable images, like Fedora, have /opt symlinked to /var/opt, in order to
## make it mutable/writable for users. However, some packages write files to this directory,
## thus its contents might be wiped out when bootc deploys an image.
# RUN rm /opt && mkdir /opt

### MODIFICATIONS
## Perform package installations and configuration steps inside build.sh
RUN --mount=type=bind,from=ctx,source=/,target=/ctx \
    --mount=type=cache,dst=/var/cache \
    --mount=type=cache,dst=/var/log \
    --mount=type=tmpfs,dst=/tmp \
    /ctx/build.sh

### LINTING
## Verify final image and contents are correct according to bootc specifications
RUN bootc container lint
